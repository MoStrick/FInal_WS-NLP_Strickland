It was going ten thousand miles an hour and was burning like hell. I said, 'What happened to your paint job?' He said, 'We've never made a paint that could withstand that kind of heat.' But I saw it come down and turn around, and it was, you know, it's like twenty-two stories tall, by the way. It looks a little smaller than that, but it's big.

But you know, I was president, and now it looks like I was going to be maybe president again, so I figured I could ask him to hold. So I asked him to hold and especially because you're going to be president again, they hold.\n",

And I said, 'Oh no.' And I said, 'Do me a favor, do you mind holding for a couple? I want to see this.' I thought it was a space age movie or something. I put the phone down, bad part I didn't pick it up for forty-five minutes, and he was holding. But this spaceship came down, and I saw those engines firing, and it looked like it was over, it was going to smash, and then I saw the fire pour out from the left side, and I put it straight, and it came down so gently, and then it wrapped those arms around it, and it held it. And just like you hold your baby at night, your little baby, and it was a beautiful thing to see.\n",

And the people from North Carolina came to me and they said, 'Would it be possible, at all possible, for you to speak to Elon Musk? We need Starlink.' I said, 'What's Starlink?' 'It's a form of communication.' So I called Elon and I'll tell you what he had. And it was very dangerous. People were dying. They had no communication. All the wires were down.\n",

And I went and I said, 'This is the roughest sport I've ever seen.' But I began to like it, and he loved it. And nobody's done a better job in sports. And you know, he's a very motivational kind of a guy, what he does.

When you think, I mean, I was looking at it, I was watching it, they had some great analysis of the people that voted for us. Nobody's ever seen anything like.
